      p Test-driven development can help you write clean code, catch bugs early, and have the confidence to change your code when you need it. In this #[strong hands-on] workshop, you will learn and practice the basics of TDD.

      p Samir Talwar and David Tanzer will take you on a guided tour of TDD. Along the way, you'll learn:

      ul
        li the #[span(style='color: #900') red], #[span(style='color: #090') green], #[span(style='color: #009') refactor] cycle
        li how to verify that you're creating the right functionality
        li tried-and-tested techniques for isolating hard-to-find bugs
        li #[em listening] to your tests, letting them guide you to a better structure
        li refactoring with a strong safety net

      p We'll start from the basics, but we'll cover advanced topics too. We'll especially focus on how to test-drive truly object-oriented code.

      p Join us for one day of deliberate practice and learning, and you'll be able to confidently apply your new skills on the job.
